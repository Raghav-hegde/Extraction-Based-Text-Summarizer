Extractive summarizers aim to pick out most relevant sentences in the document and maintain low redundancy of information in summary. 
Though anti-redundancy was not explicitly documented in older systems, most of the current systems account for it in their own novel ways.
The key ideas in this approach require performing a study on human generated abstracts,
and determine characteristics expected in automatically generated abstracts.
Mathematical and logical formulations are designed to score and pick sentences from the documents that match with manually generated abstracts.
Iteratively sentence-scoring is applied to match manually generated abstracts with automatic abstracts. 
In extractive-based methods, most important document regions (phrases, sentences, paragraphs are ranked high. 
The highest ranked regions from all documents can then be combined and re-ranked using similarity measures which in turn minimize redundancy.
Finally rules are applied to produce summary. There are different approaches to implement extractive summaries.
